/**
 * Sends Paid signal. Needs to be called as part of callback to trace().
 * When enableCostTracing flag is on, signal is associated

 *
 * @param eventName - The name of the signal.
 * @param enableCostTracing - Whether to associate this signal with cost traces
 * from the current Paid.trace() context (default: false)
 * @param data - Optional additional data to include with the signal
 *
 * @remarks
 * When enableCostTracing is on, the signal will be associated with cost
 * traces within the same Paid.trace() context.
 * It is advised to only make one call to this function
 * with enableCostTracing per Paid.trace() context.
 * Otherwise, there will be multiple signals that refer to the same costs.
